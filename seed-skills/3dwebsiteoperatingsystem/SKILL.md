name: 3dwebsiteoperatingsystem
description: A complete operating system for designing and building premium, agency-quality 3D animated websites — information architecture, visual identity, 3D interaction system, animation language, responsive layouts, accessibility strategy, and an implementation roadmap, with the purpose behind every animation explained. Use this skill whenever the user mentions a 3D website, immersive/interactive site, WebGL/Three.js/R3F experience, scroll-driven storytelling, hero animation, awwwards-style/agency-quality site, product showcase, landing page with "wow factor", motion design system, or asks to design/architect/plan a premium animated web experience. Also triggers on "3D weboldal", "látványos oldal", "immerzív", "scroll animáció", "legyen prémium/agency szintű".

# 3D Website Operating System

## Purpose
This skill turns a vague "make it look premium and 3D" request into a complete, defensible operating system: the architecture, visual identity, interaction model, motion language, responsive plan, accessibility strategy, and a phased build roadmap. It exists so every 3D site ships as a coherent system — not a pile of disconnected effects — and so every animation has a stated reason (guide attention, communicate depth, reward action, signal state, or tell story). Wow-factor with intent.

## When to use
- the user wants a new premium/immersive/3D/animated website or a redesign toward agency quality.
- Requests naming Three.js, React Three Fiber, WebGL, GSAP, ScrollTrigger, shaders, Spline, camera paths, fly-throughs, parallax, scroll storytelling.
- "Make it look expensive / awwwards-level / cinematic / immersive", hero-section motion, product 3D showcase, portfolio with motion.
- Planning phase for a site where look-and-feel and motion are the point.
- Hungarian triggers: "3D weboldal", "prémium oldal", "látványos", "immerzív", "scroll animáció", "mozgó/animált oldal".

## Instructions
Work through these seven pillars in order. Always state the *why* behind each motion/interaction decision.

1. **Discovery & positioning.** Clarify brand, audience, primary conversion goal, emotional tone (calm/luxury vs. energetic/bold), reference sites, and performance/device constraints. If unknown, propose sensible defaults and flag assumptions.
2. **Information architecture.** Define the page/section flow as a narrative spine (hook → proof → value → CTA). Map each section to its job and the single action it drives. Keep the 3D subordinate to the conversion goal.
3. **Visual identity.** Specify design tokens: color system (base, surface, accent, on-color), type scale + pairing, spacing/rhythm, radius/elevation, and a 3D material/lighting mood (metal/glass/clay, HDRI/light direction). Everything as reusable tokens.
4. **3D interaction system.** Choose the engine (Three.js / R3F / Spline) and define scene budget (draw calls, tris, texture size), camera model (orbit/scroll-path/fixed), input mapping (pointer parallax, scroll scrub, hover states), and load strategy (skeleton → progressive → interactive).
5. **Animation language.** Define easing curves, duration bands (micro 100–200ms, macro 400–800ms, cinematic 1s+), stagger rules, and choreography (entrance, scroll, hover, transition, exit). For EACH pattern, write one line: *purpose = …*.
6. **Responsive + accessibility.** Give the mobile fallback for every 3D moment (static poster / reduced scene / CSS-only), touch input mapping, and a `prefers-reduced-motion` path. Enforce WCAG AA contrast, keyboard/focus, non-motion content parity.
7. **Implementation roadmap.** Phased plan: (0) tokens+shell, (1) IA+content, (2) 2D motion, (3) 3D scene, (4) scroll wiring, (5) polish+perf budget, (6) a11y+QA. List key libraries and a perf target (LCP, INP, FPS).

Prefer delegating heavy execution: 3D scene → `threejs-specialist`, scroll wiring → `scroll-driven-3d-motion` / `gsap-motion-specialist`, design research → `frontend-design-research`, system polish → `ui-ux-design-system`.

## Output format
A single structured document (Markdown) with these headed sections, in this order:
1. **Positioning & Goal** (tone, audience, primary CTA, assumptions)
2. **Information Architecture** (section-by-section table: section · job · driven action · 3D role)
3. **Visual Identity** (token block: color / type / spacing / material-lighting)
4. **3D Interaction System** (engine, scene budget, camera, input, load strategy)
5. **Animation Language** (pattern table: pattern · trigger · easing/duration · **purpose**)
6. **Responsive & Accessibility** (per-moment fallback + reduced-motion + WCAG notes)
7. **Implementation Roadmap** (phases 0–6, libraries, perf targets)

Use tables where noted. Keep every motion entry paired with its purpose. Code/config snippets in English; only produce runnable code when the user asks to build (otherwise stay at system/plan altitude).

## Examples

**Example 1**
Input (a felhasználó): "Kell egy prémium 3D landing egy AI SaaS-nak, legyen látványos de konvertáljon."
Output: Full OS doc — Positioning (confident, calm-tech tone; CTA = "Start free"); IA spine (hero hook → live 3D product diorama → social proof → pricing → CTA); tokens (near-black base, electric-cyan accent, glass material, single key light); 3D system (R3F, ≤120k tris, scroll-path camera through the diorama, pointer parallax); animation table where "hero float loop → purpose: signal the product is alive & interactive"; mobile fallback = static hero render + CSS gradient sheen; reduced-motion = fade only; roadmap phases 0–6 with LCP < 2.5s / 60fps desktop targets.

**Example 2**
Input (a felhasználó): "Csak a hero szekció animációs nyelvét tervezd meg egy portfólióhoz."
Output: Scoped Animation Language section only — easing set, duration bands, choreography for entrance (text mask-reveal, stagger 60ms → purpose: lead the eye down the headline), pointer parallax on 3D bust (purpose: communicate depth without a click), scroll-scrub camera dolly (purpose: transition from intro to work), plus reduced-motion variants for each.

## Language rules
- Converse with the user in **Hungarian**; refer to the user only as **a felhasználó**.
- Keep all code, config, token names, library names, easing/timing values, and technical terms in **English** (e.g. `ScrollTrigger`, `prefers-reduced-motion`, `cubic-bezier`, `--color-accent`).
- Section headings in the output may stay English (they're technical/structural); prose explanation in Hungarian.

## What to avoid
- **Effects without purpose.** Never add motion you can't justify in one line — cut it.
- **3D over conversion.** The scene serves the CTA; don't bury the primary action behind a 10-second cinematic.
- **No mobile/reduced-motion plan.** Every 3D moment needs a fallback and a `prefers-reduced-motion` path — non-negotiable.
- **Unbounded scenes.** No tri-count/texture/draw-call budget = jank. Always set a perf budget and LCP/FPS target.
- **Token-less styling.** No hardcoded hex/px scattered in components; drive everything from the token system.
- **Autoplay audio, hijacked native scroll, motion that traps or nauseates.** Respect user control and WCAG.
- **Jumping to code too early.** Lock the system (IA + tokens + motion language) before building, unless the user explicitly says "build it now".
