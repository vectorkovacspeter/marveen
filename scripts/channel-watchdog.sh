# Independent channels watchdog (systemd --user timer, every 5 min).
#
# WHY a separate timer when the dashboard already has an in-process watchdog:
# the dashboard's watchdog dies WITH the dashboard. This timer is independent,
# so a wedged channels session is still recovered even if the dashboard process
# is down. It is the COARSE net (total-pipe-death / session-wedge); the
# dashboard's userbot inbound-probe handles the finer inbound-only deafness.
#
# Two INDEPENDENT detection signals (PLAN.md GAP 2b, 2026-07-23
# marveen-channels silent outage -- the keepalive signal alone never sees a
# dead model-API token, since the token-free keepalive probe only exercises
# the Telegram Bot API, not Claude):
#   STALE    -- store/.channel-keepalive mtime. Two token-free producers keep
#               it fresh: channel-monitor advances it on organic inbound, and
#               the idle-path channel-keepalive-probe.sh timer touches it every
#               ~3 min while the telegram poller is alive under the channels
#               session. A stale file means the session's channel pipe is
#               genuinely down (wedged / deaf), not merely quiet.
#   AUTHDEAD -- scripts/channels-auth-probe.mjs scans the live pane for the
#               same dead-token markers reauth-healer.ts already detects
#               (Please run /login, API Error: 401, OAuth token expired, ...),
#               ignoring the first-run-gate family (out of scope for this arm).
#               Requires AUTH_DEAD_THRESHOLD_TICKS consecutive dead ticks
#               (~10-15min) before acting -- deliberately coarser than
#               reauth-healer's own ~9-10min confirm cadence, so in the common
#               case (dashboard alive) reauth-healer wins the race and this
#               counter resets to 0 on the next tick without ever firing. This
#               arm only actually fires when reauth-healer couldn't (dashboard
#               down, or channels.sh itself hung) -- the designed backstop role.
#
# Either signal proceeds to the shared grace/backoff/recover step below.
#
# Recovery: `tmux respawn-pane` of ONLY the <id>-channels pane -- the precise,
# fleet-safe restart of just the main channels session. (Historically a
# `systemctl restart` was outright forbidden here: the shared tmux SERVER lives
# in the channels unit's cgroup, and under the old KillMode=control-group a
# restart SIGKILLed the server and every agent session, not just the main one --
# the 2026-06-26 fleet outage. The unit now runs KillMode=process so a restart is
# no longer catastrophic, but respawn-pane stays preferred: it recovers only the
# wedged pane without disturbing any sibling session.)
#
# Safety: a respawn-grace stamp prevents storming; a consecutive-respawn cap
# stops a useless respawn loop when the keepalive is disabled or the problem is
# systemic (it then alerts via the log and backs off instead).
