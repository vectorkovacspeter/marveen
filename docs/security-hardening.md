# Git force-push guard

Marveen agents run autonomously, often with shell access and the ability to push
to git, so a prompt-injected or simply mistaken agent can rewrite shared history.
This guard reduces that blast radius without changing how the fleet works.

## What it does

`scripts/install-git-guard-hook.sh` installs a `pre-push` hook that **refuses a
non-fast-forward (force / rebase / amend) push to `main` or `master`**. Normal
fast-forwards and merge commits pass untouched, and every other ref (`develop`,
feature branches, fork branches, including `--force-with-lease` to those) is
unaffected: only history rewrites of a protected branch are blocked.

It is named `install-*-hook.sh`, so `scripts/sync-hooks.sh` (and the dashboard
update flow) run it automatically. It composes with an existing `pre-push` hook
(e.g. a secret scanner) by moving it under `.git/hooks/pre-push.d/` and adding a
small dispatcher that feeds the ref list to every sub-hook.

```bash
scripts/install-git-guard-hook.sh   # runs automatically on update; manual run also works
```

Override an intentional rewrite of a protected branch:

```bash
ALLOW_FORCE_PUSH=1 git push ...
```
