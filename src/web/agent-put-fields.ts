// up an HTTP context: the handler itself needs a request, a response, the

// would have gone untested — and this rule is exactly the kind that needs a test,
// because its failure mode is silence.
//
// Background: the handler used to destructure the fields it understood and drop
// everything else, then answer 200 {ok:true}. On 2026-07-27 a securityProfile
// was PUT here four times, acknowledged every time and never applied; the agent
// stayed in a mode where it stopped for approval on every tool call and was
// unusable for hours while the API kept reporting success.
