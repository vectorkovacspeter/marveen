// Durable per-agent BASE model, for the weekly-tier stepdown (card 5d2002b5, owner policy: "EZ A LEGFONTOSABB").
//
// The tier ramp steps each agent DOWN from its own base model, and reverts it back UP to that base
// once the weekly % falls. The base therefore has to OUTLIVE a dashboard restart: the previous
// design kept it only in the runner's in-memory `downgradedAt` map, so a restart mid-ramp lost every
// base -- and a stepped-down agent then reverted to the global chain[0], or got stuck on the cheap
// model, instead of climbing back to the model it actually started on.
//
// So the base is written HERE, to store/model-tier-baseline.json, the first time an agent is stepped
// down (its then-current model is, by definition, its base). Memory holds only the revert TIMING;
// the base is read from disk. A record is cleared when the agent is back on its base, so the file
// tracks exactly the currently-downgraded set.
