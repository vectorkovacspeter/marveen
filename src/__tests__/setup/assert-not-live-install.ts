// GLOBAL SUITE GATE: refuse to run the test suite inside a LIVE install.
//
// 2026-07-27, one full-suite run in the production checkout: settings-store.test.ts
// rmSync'd the live store/config-overrides.json (dropping MAIN_AGENT_ISOLATED_CONFIG
// and ultimately 401-ing the main agent that evening), env.test.ts unlink+rewrote the
// live .env (mode 600 -> 644), and the auth suites pushed real break-glass Telegram
// alerts to the owner. Tests must only ever run from a worktree/CI checkout whose
// store/ carries no runtime state.
//
// Detection is marker-based, not path-based: a live install is recognized by the
// runtime artifacts only a running fleet produces. A fresh clone or worktree has
// none of them, so CI and PR-verify flows are unaffected. This is a HARD failure
// on purpose -- a silent skip would hide that someone is one `npm test` away from
// mutating production state (loaded via vitest `setupFiles`, so it gates every
// worker; per-file guards cannot be forgotten this way).
