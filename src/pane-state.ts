// Pure-logic detector for a tmux pane running Claude Code.
//
// Motivation: the scheduler used a single regex (`/esc to interrupt/`) to
// decide whether a target session could accept a new prompt. Between a
// user turn's submission and the spinner's first render there is a frame-
// scale window where the footer shows only `⏵⏵ bypass permissions on
// (shift+tab to cycle)` WITHOUT the `· esc to interrupt` suffix. A
// scheduler tick landing in that window mis-detected "ready", called
// sendPromptToSession, and the prompt sat in the input buffer until the
// post-send retry gave up. The new detector:
//
//   - Recognises a wider range of positive busy indicators (spinner
//     glyph labels + token-count pattern + tool-use mid-turn lines)
//     so the frame-level footer gap no longer yields a false positive.
//   - Returns a discrete state so the caller can distinguish idle /
//     busy / typing / unknown and react per state.
//
// The module has ZERO imports so it is trivially unit-testable against
// captured pane fixtures. The I/O (capture-pane + double-sample) lives
// in src/web.ts alongside the rest of the scheduler.

export type PaneState = 'idle' | 'busy' | 'typing' | 'unknown' | 'error'

// Claude Code shows the footer in one of two modes: the default "bypass"
// permissions mode (permissive) and the "strict" mode. Both are "idle"
// surfaces. If neither is visible the pane is not a recognised Claude
// Code surface and we report 'unknown' rather than guess.
//
// The bypass-mode footer has known trailing variants after the
// "bypass permissions on" prefix: the original "(shift+tab to cycle)"
// hint, and the background-shells indicator which Claude Code
// substitutes when one or more BashTool background shells are running
// in the session. The background-shells indicator itself comes in two
// shapes depending on whether the tasks panel is visible:
//   - tasks visible:  "· N shells · ctrl+t to hide tasks · ↓ to manage"
//   - tasks hidden:   "· N shells · ↓ to manage"
// All variants must classify as idle, otherwise sessions that spawn
// background shells (gh poll, file watchers, long-running build) get
// stuck pending forever.
//
// The shells-variant requires either the "· ctrl+t" marker or the
// "· ↓ to manage" tail after the shell count, rather than just the
// bare "· N shell(s)" prefix. Two reasons:
//   (a) one of these tails is always what Claude Code actually renders,
//       so insisting on either rejects malformed or mid-render frames;
//   (b) it disambiguates the footer from scrollback content that
//       happens to contain "bypass permissions on · 1 shell" verbatim
//       (an echoed log line, a quoted message, etc.) which would
//       otherwise be misread as idle.

// Positive busy signals. ANY match anywhere in the pane means the turn
// is mid-flight, even if the footer looks idle for a frame.
//
// Deliberately narrow: only signals that disappear THE MOMENT a turn
// ends. Two failure modes we explicitly avoid:
//
//   (A) Scrollback persistence. Tool-use summary lines (`Searched for /
//       Listed / Read`) stay rendered above the input box after the
//       turn ends, and Claude Code never overwrites them. A regex
//       matching those would starve the scheduler forever.
//
//   (B) Prose false positive. The standalone word "Thinking…" or
//       "Crafting…" could legitimately appear in Claude's reply text
//       (Markdown headings, list items, quoted content). Matching the
//       label alone would read that prose as mid-turn. To avoid this
//       we require the label to be followed by the parenthesised
//       runtime marker `(Ns · ↓` -- an UI chrome signature that
//       cannot appear in reply text.
//
// The load-bearing signal is the tokens-down-arrow pattern `(Ns · ↓N`,
// which every extended-thinking turn renders regardless of spinner
// label. `esc to interrupt` is the footer-scoped fallback checked only
// in the live footer region (see LIVE_FOOTER_REGION_LINES below) to
// prevent prose-quoting false positives. A future Claude Code release
// that renames the spinner labels will miss the label regex but still

//       prints before a turn-level error. Prose that quotes "API Error
//       400" in a message body has no leading `⎿  API Error: <num>`.
//   (c) Specific phrase: the thinking-block signature `cannot be
//       modified` together with `thinking` or `redacted_thinking`. A
//       generic API error (rate limit, overloaded) is NOT this class.
//
// (b) and (c) are required WITHIN ONE CHROME BLOCK (the chrome line plus
// its wrapped continuation), not anywhere in the joined tail. Otherwise

 *   - Wall-clock stagnation `(now - stagnantSince) >= freezeSeconds`. A
 *     healthy long-running call increments the counter every TUI redraw,
 *     so stagnantSince keeps resetting to null and the duration never
 *     accumulates. A wedged TUI lets it accumulate.
 *   - Anti-fluke: stagnantPolls >= thresholds.stagnantPolls (two
 *     consecutive non-incrementing observations), composed AND with the
 *     wall-clock check.
 *   - Recovery is one-shot per spell (attempts cap at 1). The next sweep
 *     reads a fresh pane after the respawn.
 *   - A tag change (e.g. Brewed -> Worked) or counter increment resets
 *     the spell -- both are genuine progress.
