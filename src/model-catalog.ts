//
// Before this, the agent model-picker dropdown (src/web/routes/agents.ts) and the weekly-tier
// stepdown each carried their own hardcoded list, and the tier stepped every agent onto an ABSOLUTE
// chain index -- so a Haiku-based agent and an Opus-based agent both landed on `chain[1]`, ignoring
// where each STARTED. This module is the single list both features read, plus the capability-ordered
// ladder the stepdown walks, plus the pure per-agent target computation.
//
// Adding a model in ONE place (CLAUDE_MODELS, and its rung in MODEL_LADDER) surfaces it in the
// dropdown AND makes it a valid tier target automatically -- no second edit.

/** The Claude models an operator may assign, id + human label. The agent dropdown renders this

/**
 * The tier ladder: capability/price DESCENDING. Stepping one tier down the weekly ramp moves an
 * agent one rung further along this list, starting from where its OWN base model sits. Defined
 * explicitly (not derived from the dropdown order) because "which model is a cheaper substitute for
 * which" is a judgement, not the display order -- but it is defined HERE, next to the list, so a new
 * model is ranked in the same edit that adds it.
 *
 * Fable 5 > Opus 5 > Sonnet 5 > Sonnet 4.6 > Haiku 4.5.
 *
 * Fable 5 sits at the front (the operator caught a prior mis-ranking 2026-08-02): Anthropic's own
 * pricing puts it ABOVE Opus 5 ($10/$50 per MTok vs Opus 5's $5/$25) and describes it as "Anthropic's
 * most capable widely released model" -- the most expensive AND most capable rung, not the cheapest.
 *
 * REVISED 2026-08-03 (owner policy: per-agent chain policy): Opus 4.8 was REMOVED from the ladder so
 * the ramp steps map exactly to the chains the operator specified. The operator watches only the
 * WEEKLY limit (the 5h banner axis is irrelevant here). With one rung per tier from each agent's own
 * base, the chains fall out cleanly: a coding agent based on Opus 5 goes Opus 5 -> Sonnet 5 -> Sonnet
 * 4.6 (2 tiers, never Haiku); a front-end/support agent based on Sonnet 5 goes Sonnet 5 -> Sonnet 4.6
 * -> Haiku 4.5; a light agent based on Sonnet 4.6 goes Sonnet 4.6 -> Haiku 4.5. Opus 4.8 stays
 * selectable in CLAUDE_MODELS but is no longer a ramp rung (nothing uses it as a base). See
 * applyNoHaikuFloor below for the QA-gate carve-out.
