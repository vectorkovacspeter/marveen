// The weekly HARD STOP flag (card d08b98f4, the operator's decision).
//
// The existing weekly rule only ever stopped NEW development: in-flight cards finished and the
// QA/Cybersec/Cybered gates kept running, which is right at 90% and wrong at 98% -- gate work is
// Claude work too, and at that point the fleet is spending the last of the week's quota on it.
//
// So there is now a second, harder level (testStop, default 97). At or above it EVERY role agent is
// parked and no gate work is dispatched; only the main agent stays alive, because rule 7 makes it the
// one agent that must keep monitoring, answering the operator and restarting the fleet afterwards.
//
// store/pre-dispatch-check.sh WRITES this file on every run (it is the one place that already knows
// the weekly percentage). This module is the READ side for the TypeScript half -- the dashboard panel
// and any orchestrator code -- so both halves agree on what is true without re-deriving it.
//
// FAIL-OPEN ON PURPOSE, and only here: an unreadable/missing flag reports `active: false`. The flag is
// a STOP signal, not a permission; treating "I could not read it" as "everything is stopped" would
// park the whole fleet on a corrupt file. The weekly percentage itself is still checked by the gate
// script before any dispatch, so a lost flag costs a tick, not the control.

/**
 * Pure predicate for the NEW-DEV stop (the operator, 2026-08-01): a `planned` card moving to
 * `in_progress` OR straight to `waiting` IS the start of new development and must be refused once
 * the weekly newDevStop threshold is crossed. A direct `planned -> waiting` skip was added
 * 2026-08-02: after the `force`-actor fix closed the `planned -> in_progress` bypass, a role-agent
 * (`backend`, card `adaa5217`) got a 409 on `{"status":"in_progress","force":true}` and simply sent
 * `{"status":"waiting"}` instead -- since the guard only ever checked `nextStatus === 'in_progress'`,
 * a card that already had real (uncommitted-until-then) work skipped the checkpoint entirely and
 * landed straight on `waiting+REVIEW`, gate-eligible, with zero rows in between. In the intended
 * lifecycle (planned -> in_progress -> waiting -> done) a planned card has no legitimate reason to
 * reach `waiting` without passing through `in_progress` first, so both target statuses are guarded
 * the same way. `waiting -> in_progress` (a FAIL-fix / gate resume) is NOT new dev and stays allowed.
 * `force` is meant as the main agent's deliberate override for a critical-infra exception
 * (kanban.ts:27) -- it only overrides when the caller is one of `flag.exemptAgents` (the main
 * agent); everyone else's force is ignored. Pure so the status-write endpoints can test the decision
 * without a file/DB.
